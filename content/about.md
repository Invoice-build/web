# About Invoice.build

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is [Gareth Fuller](https://twitter.com/garethafuller), I am the founder / creator of invoice.build.

As is fairly obvious from the home page, Invoice.build is an invoice builder for Ethereum tokens. It makes creating and issuing invoices in Ethereum and a selection of Ethereum based stablecoins extremely simple. The resulting invoice payment pages can then be paid off with a variety of Web3 wallets.

Invoice.build is built for contractors, freelancers and businesses who charge in crypto and want to give their clients a simple way to pay off their invoices.

The idea for Invoice.build actually grew out of this need. I previously founded a payment processing app for crypto businesses and needed a way to simply invoice my users every month (there wasn't a lot of users). Since recurring SaaS payments in stablecoins are not that easy to do at this point all I needed was a way to generate a simple payment page that represented an invoice.

I also happened to have a friend who was working for one of the big ERC20 projects that came out of the 2017 boom. He was invoicing that company in Ether (ETH) on a monthly basis and the process, as he described it, was a pain.

This is basically what lead me to build invoice.build. It's generally relevant to my job and industry, and specifically relevant to some experience I've gained from other projects I've been responsible for.

Eventually, I'd like to provide an API or maybe even an Ethereum protocol that allows other apps to easily integrate similar functionality within their own apps and DApps.

Perhaps one day it might provide the option to utilize the more interesting payment protocols made possible by Ethereum, like [Sablier](https://sablier.finance), so invoice payments could be streamed over time.

This is what I love so much about Ethereum, the composability of value transfer, there are so many options and everything is open.

I have also open-sourced everything about Invoice.build, the code, roadmap and analytics. I have written a little about why I did that here: https://garethfullers.site/blog/im-open-sourcing-my-next-side-project/
